						<h6>Secretary General</h6>
						<h5>Brian Son</h5>
						<p>
							Brian Son, the first Secretary-General of the Canadian Youth Debate Council Model United Nations, is a Grade 12 student at R.E. Mountain Secondary School. Wanting to increase the quality of debate for delegates from different ethnic backgrounds, Brian Son is proud to promote one of the greatest MUN conference in the lower mainland. Prior to his appointment as Secretary-General, Brian Son serves as BC Forensic League trainer from July 2017. Even though being an ESL student has hindered him from clearly expressing opinions, it couldn't stop his passionate and exotic interest in the field of politics. As the first debater pursuing arts at college, you could easily find him designing conference logos and promotional posters endlessly. Brian hopes to serve passionate and energetic delegates with various types of interest to make this conference “dank.”

						<h6>Director General</h6>
						<h5>Helen Huang</h5>
						<p>
							As a Grade 11 student at MEI Secondary School, Helen Huang first entered the world of Model United Nations and Debate in Grade 8 with an immense fear of public speaking. After 2 years of forcing herself to attend debate tournaments to get over her fear, Helen has never once underestimated her love of speech and is honoured to serve as the Director General for CYDC Model United Nations 2018. Even though she commits herself to Public Forum Debate, her love for Model United Nations only recently blossomed and has continuously grown after she found thrill in staffing at conferences. Apart from MUN, Helen works as a Debate Intern at BC Forensic League a non-profit organization which has captivated her love in the world of American-style debate. If she’s not in a blazer, you’d find her as an Alto Saxophone player or fulfilling her wish to become a Medical student.

						<h6>Chief of Staff</h6>
						<h5>Alex Oh</h5>
						<p>
							Alex is an unusually short junior at RE Mountain Secondary School with a extravagant interest in Business, MUN, Debate, and oddly, Fashion. From attending his first conference as just another weekend to spend with his fellow prepubescent grade 7 boys to now scavenging for any opportunity to help further his passion in debating about current events and serving in leadership opportunities, he has enjoyed every last moment and opportunities that MUN has present to him. When he isn’t in his perfectly colour coordinated suit attending conferences, case competitions or debate invitationals, Alex is found volunteering at various organizations, forming questionable poetry or stalking inspirational and unique fashion accounts on Instagram. As the Chief of Staff Alex has the utmost confidence that CYDCMUN will not only be an remarkable experience, but a rewardable one as well. Alex is more than ecstatic to meet everyone in March.

						<h6>Director of Operations</h6>
						<h5>Jenny Jung</h5>
						<p>
							Growing up, Jenny had never viewed herself as a speaker. If someone were to ask her, what she thought made a speaker, she would have told them that speakers are simply born into the role. This belief changed drastically the moment she entered the world of forensics. Attending Brookswood Secondary School as a Junior, Jenny is proud to be the Director of Operations for the first iteration of CYDC Model United Nations. For over a course of six years, Jenny has been part of the BC Forensic League Association and gained countless strengths through her continuous participation in Canadian and American-style Debates, Business, Mock Trials, Public Speaking, and most importantly, Model United Nations. Jenny hopes that every student will have the opportunity through this conference to acquire more knowledge with world occurrences, develop leadership skills, and most importantly to leverage the MUN experience and network to help determine what one truly desires to become in this era of globalization.

						<h6>Delegate Affairs</h6>
						<h5>Ryan Choi</h5>
						<p>
							A grade 10 at South Delta Secondary School, Ryan has been an active participant in the world of MUN for the past few years. Fond recollections of this include enthusiastic speeches delivered past midnight, tiringly repetitive resolutions with far too many sub-clauses, and excessively aggressive applause for the most non sensible reasons. When he is not playing rugby, or finishing his homework, Ryan can be found video gaming and socialising with his friends. Ryan is excited to be serving as the USG Delegate Affairs and looks forward to a wonderful conference.

						<h6>USG of Committees</h6>
						<h5>Hoony Oh</h5>
						<p>
							As a grade 11 MUN fanatic from Sardis Secondary, Hoony Oh is excited to be a part of the secretariat team as the USG of Committees for the very first iteration of CYDCMun 2018! Having first stepped into the world of Model United Nations in Grade 9, Hoony still remembers his first conference as one filled with excitement, joy, and a bit of anxiety, but none the less still a memory he can never forget. Now, he works and strives toward spreading the same experiences to as many people as possible. When not hitting gavels on tables, you might find Hoony at debating at American tournaments, reffing basketball games or watching a couple seasons on Netflix. He looks forward to meeting all of you in 2018!

						<h6>USG of IT</h6>
						<h5>Jae Wu Chun</h5>
						<p>
							"Stop playing games!" his mom would always say, when he wasn't playing games. Jae Wu is a grade 9 student attending Pacific Academy High School. Being drawn into computers at a young age, he taught himself various computer programming languages. His fascination ranged from a computer's hardware to software to the internet and websites. However, while growing up Jae Wu realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to pursue that path so he started looking into other extra curriculars and found Public Speaking. Which made him even more unsure. Nevertheless, he strives for greatness in Public Speaking, including Debate and Model United Nations, because the skills that are acquired through those practices are vital for accurately articulating thoughts.
